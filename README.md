# Tokenizers-LLM-From-Scratch

In December 2023 I brought the book 'Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)' by Sebastian Raschka https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch. There are also great code implementations by author https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch even though the book is still in early access.
